# Timeline - Photo

As part of my fellowship at Poynter, I created a [timeline](http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/371490/tragic-images-of-children-captured-by-photojournalists-over-time/) using WNYC's [Tik-Tok](https://github.com/datanews/tik-tok) and added custom functions to blur images using CSS.
